### PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY  
I am a highly skilled Data Analyst and SQL Developer in performance reporting, SQL development, and technical documentation. I enjoy translating complex data into accessible, actionable formats, whether for stakeholders, technical teams, or learning communities. I have translated complex data into actionable insights using SQL, Excel, and Python, and also adept at optimizing databases, building APIs via stored procedures, and leading cross-functional collaboration for performance optimization and digital transformation. I am currently exploring opportunities in Web3 and open-source development. I was previously engaged with the Dune Analytics ecosystem, where I built SQL-based dashboards on public blockchain data and documented my findings to share insights with the community.
